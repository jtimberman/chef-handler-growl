Description
===========

This is a simple Chef report handler that reports status of a Chef run
through Growl.

* http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Exception+and+Report+Handlers

Requirements
============

Platform: Mac OS X

Growl: Tested with version 1.3.2

Uses the `ruby_gntp` library.

Usage
=====

There are two ways to use Chef Handlers.

### Method 1

You can install the RubyGem ahead of time, and configure Chef to use
them. To do so:

    gem install chef-handler-growl

Then add to the configuration (`/etc/chef/solo.rb` for chef-solo or
`/etc/chef/client.rb` for chef-client):

    require "chef/handler/growl"
    report_handlers << Chef::Handler::Growl.new
    exception_handlers << Chef::Handler::Growl.new

### Method 2

Use the
[chef_handler cookbook by Opscode](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef_handler).
Create a recipe with the following:

    # Install the `chef-handler-growl` RubyGem during the compile phase
    gem_package "chef-handler-growl" do
      action :nothing
    end.run_action(:install)

    # Then activate the handler with the `chef_handler` LWRP
    chef_handler "Chef::Handler::Growl" do
      source "chef/handler/growl"
      action :enable
    end

Roadmap
=======

Things I would like to add:

* rspec tests - both Chef::Handler and GNTP#notify have specs, so this
  was low priority.
* GNTP over the network capability. For example, if I have three
  virtual machines running Chef on an interval, I'd like them to send
  notification to my Mac workstation I'm using.

These are created as issues. Pull requests welcome.
